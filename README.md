## Synopsis

The Cerebellum is the part of our brain that is in charge of coordinating, predicting and learning our movements. It consists of a complex but well organized network of different kind of neuron cells. We are going to simulate a sub part of this network using NEST, the state of the art simulator for point neurons analysis. This kind of analysis usually doesn't care about the physical topology of the synapses, nor the length of the axons and collapses the physical behaviour of the neruon into a mathematical model. 

## Motivation

Such kind of simulations are used to study the overall behaviour of the neural net and thanks to their relative simplicity can be simulated in a fair amount of time. They offer a high level of parallelism and a proper architecture may use them in real time to control robotic parts, exploiting the inner ability of the cerebellum to control and learn movements.
